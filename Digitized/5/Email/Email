Dear Shule,

I compiled all the data I evaluated in 2007 study.

I remembered that I mainly evaluated the Vs change in this study since I only detect "postcursor" for  most of the ScP waveforms.
The postcursor to the ScP waveform is dominantly sensitive to the S wave velocity reduction, so I evaluated only Vs change.

I attached three files & shell script (vs-delta.sh).

* hinscp.nondtctd: Reflection lat & lng of ScP observed in Hi-net (ScsP not-detected)
* imsscp.nondtctd: Reflection lat & lng of ScP observed in IMS-arrays (ScsP not-detected)
* scsp_detected.dat: Reflection lat & lng of ScP with ScsP (Both Hi-net & IMS-Arrays)

Can you tell me if you have any question?

Thank you,
Koki
