Hi Shule, for the data I used in that paper I attach a table that has all of the info.  The columns give the information in the table attached at the end of this email.  Not sure if you were asking for this?

For the summary figures of the old studies, I can't find the script to plot those figures anywhere.  Some of those were just digitized straight out of the papers, but others - particularly the ScP, PcP studies I calculated the bouncepoints from event/station pairs reported in those papers (where it actually was reported).  I'm sure I have a table of all those values somewhere, but I can't find where I put them.  Mike

Field        Parameter
-----        -----------------------------------------------------------------
  1          Station abbreviation
  2          Event abbreviation (yymmdd_hhmm)
  3          Event Latitude (deg)
  4          Event Longitude (deg)
  5          Station Latitude (deg)
  6          Station Longitude (deg)
  7          Source-side SPdKS endpoint 1 Lat (deg) - based on PREM model*
  8          Source-side SPdKS endpoint 1 Lon (deg) - based on PREM model*
  9          Source-side SPdKS endpoint 2 Lat (deg) - based on PREM model*
  10         Source-side SPdKS endpoint 2 Lon (deg) - based on PREM model*
  11         Receiver-side SKPdS endpoint 1 Lat (deg) - based on PREM model*
  12         Receiver-side SKPdS endpoint 1 Lon (deg) - based on PREM model*
  13         Receiver-side SKPdS endpoint 2 Lat (deg) - based on PREM model*
  14         Receiver-side SKPdS endpoint 2 Lon (deg) - based on PREM model*
  15         Great circle arc distance between event and station (deg).  This is calculated for a spherical earth.
