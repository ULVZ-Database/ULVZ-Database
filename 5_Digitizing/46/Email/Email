Hi Shule, sorry this took so long to get to you.

Attached is a c-shell script that will plot the ULVZ locations from the 2013 EPSL paper.

The ULVZ locations are in the psxy calls, and give the lon, lats of the positions.

I will ask Jensen to send me his script for plotting the locations from the GRL paper as well.

I looked around his directories but have no idea where he stored stuff. 

Mike
